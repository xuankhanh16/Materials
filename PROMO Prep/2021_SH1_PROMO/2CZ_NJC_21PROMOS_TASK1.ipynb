To help manage the identification of the customers, the manager of the restaurant opted for a low-cost solution of using a one-dimensional fixed-size array to store these ID numbers. The array is first initialized with `None` elements and the elements in this array is indexed from `0` to `(Max-1)`, where `Max` is size of the array.\n",
