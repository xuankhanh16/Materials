        "When the routine is called with an actual input, the input is called an **argument**, i.e., the arguments supplied are assigned to the corresponding parameter of the routine. Do note the order of the parameters in the parameter list must be the same as the order in the list of arguments. Using our example above, in the expression `square(2)`, `2` is the argument.\n",

        "Recursion is very powerful, and often results in a very elegant solution to a problem. However, as explained previously, each time a routine is called, it invokes a new stack. Thus, because of the stack overheads, recursive algorithms may not be as efficient as iterative solutions. In contrast, an iterative solution typically only utilises a single stack. Additionally, if many recursive calls are made, stack space could run out. This is known as a stack overflow."

        "Advantages\n",
        "* Recursive functions make the code look clean and elegant.\n",
        "* A complex task can be broken down into simpler sub-problems using recursion.\n",
        "* Sequence generation is easier with recursion than using some nested iteration.\n",

        "How recursion works\n",
        "1. Each time a recursive function is called, a new stack frame, containing function's local variables, parameters, and the return address (the point to return to after the function finishes execution), is created.\n",
        "2. The newly created stack frame is pushed onto the call stack. This means that the execution context of the current function call is saved at the top of the stack. The stack grows with each recursive call.\n",
        "3. The execution of the current function is suspended. The new function call is executed with its own stack frame at the top of the stack.\n",
        "4. When a base case is reached or the function completes its task, the function returns a value. The current stack frame is then popped from the stack, and the execution resumes from the return address saved in the stack frame of the previous function call. This process continues until all recursive calls are resolved and the stack is empty again.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recursion in Python\n",
        "* Python stops the function calls after a depth of 1000 calls, and throws a `RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exeeded..` error.\n",
